      <description>The Ethiopia Jobs Compact’s commitment to providing formal economic opportunities ignores the likelihood that many refugees will be able to find only informal work, writes law professor Jennifer Gordon.

      <description>Mixed migration flows represent a small proportion of human mobility but have seriously disrupted migration and refugee policy as well as politics worldwide.

      <description>The move to consider an E.U.-wide humanitarian visa is a chance for member states to take action on a long-debated concept, and to show global leadership with life-saving consequences for people in need of protection, writes researcher Claire Higgins.</description>

      <description>The E.U., U.K. and U.S. like to see themselves as moral standard-bearers in the international community.
