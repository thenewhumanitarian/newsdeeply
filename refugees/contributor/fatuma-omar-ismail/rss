    <title>Refugees contributor: Fatuma Omar Ismail</title>
    <description>Fatuma Omar Ismail studies chemical engineering at the University of Toronto in Canada on a scholarship. She spent most of her childhood in Dadaab, a complex of refugee camps in northern Kenya, near the border with Somalia, where much of her family still resides. She came to international prominence after her outstanding exam results saw her given a rare place at one of Kenya’s best girls schools. Living between Dadaab and Nairobi, she built on the opportunity given to her to earn the right to study abroad.
