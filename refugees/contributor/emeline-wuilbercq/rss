    <title>Refugees contributor: Emeline Wuilbercq</title>
    <description>Emeline Wuilbercq is a French freelance journalist based in Ethiopia since 2015. She’s passionate about people, but she prefers by far having a chat with farmers from the countryside of Ethiopia rather than interviewing high-level officials who swarm in Addis Ababa.
