    <title>Refugees contributor: Negar Tayyar</title>
    <description>Negar Tayyar, philanthropic adviser, is managing the Global Whole Being Fund, a global grantmaking body in the San Francisco Bay Area. The fund is supporting work across different migration routes in 14 countries. The GWBF is assisting “people on the move” to find meaning and belonging in transit and destination countries. The aim is to transform the refugee support system and expand the concept of “basic needs” and include holistic support covering psychosocial and communal well-being as critical needs.

      <description>Most grantmakers approach refugees and their local communities as a problem to be solved. Philanthropy experts Christine Mendonça and Negar Tayyar call for a shift to an asset-based approach, where refugees’ experiences and skills are part of the solution.</description>
