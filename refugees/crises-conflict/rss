      <description>The E.U., U.K. and U.S. like to see themselves as moral standard-bearers in the international community.

      <description>Some 300,000 Salvadorans were displaced last year, and many remain on the run from gang violence. Elizabeth Ferris and Walter Kalin explain why a new draft law on internal displacement in El Salvador is a chance to help them and provide a model for other countries.</description>
