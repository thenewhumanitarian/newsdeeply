			<h1>News Deeply Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h1>Last Updated: May 23, 2018</h1>

      <p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the News Deeply Terms of Service (the <b>“Terms”</b>). The terms “News Deeply,” “we,” and “us” include News Deeply and our affiliates and subsidiaries. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information (both online and offline) that we receive through our Services, including the kinds of information we collect, how we intend to use and share that information, and how you can opt out, correct or change such information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Third-Party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms.</p>
      
      <p>This  Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is Processed by us in the course of our business, including on our websites (each a “Site” or “Sites”), our mobile applications (“<b>App</b>”), forums, blogs, and other online or offline offerings (together with any and all future online and offline offerings operated by or on behalf of News Deeply, the “Services”). All individuals whose responsibilities include the Processing of Personal Information on behalf of News Deeply are expected to protect that data by adherence to this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Revisions to this Privacy Policy.</strong> Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> <strong>Transparency/Notice – Types of Personal Information We Collect.</strong> The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from Third-Party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with us and the requirements of applicable law. Some of the ways that we may collect Personal Information include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> You may provide Personal Information directly to News Deeply through interacting with the Services, participating in surveys, during events such as sweepstakes, and requesting Services, or information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> As you navigate the Services, certain passive information may also be collected about your visit, including through Cookies and similar technologies as described below.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>We endeavor to collect only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Below are the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Information Collected or Received from You.</strong> Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>
          
          <p>News Deeply collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective, and former customers, Users (defined in subsection (b) below), visitors, guests, and Employees (collectively <strong>“Individuals”</strong>).</p>

          <p>(a) <u>Account Information.</u> If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain Personal Information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number and a profile picture. If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your social networking services accounts (<strong>“SNS Accounts”</strong>), we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other  Personal Information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, job title, date of birth and other information that may not be Personal Information. Additionally, you may have the option of providing certain other information such as links to content you have created, outside websites, and your own publications.</p>

          <p>(b) <u>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies.</u> Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies, Web Beacons, Log Data, and Social Media Widgets (collectively <strong>“Web Technologies”</strong>) to collect certain information.</p>

          <p><strong>“Cookies”</strong> are small text files that are placed on your device by a web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some Third-Party services providers that we engage (including Third-Party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your device. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such Third-Parties.</p>

          <p><strong>“Web Beacons”</strong> (also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p>

          <p><strong>“Log Data”</strong> means certain information about how a person uses our Services, including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a <strong>“User”</strong>). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, MAC address, IMEI, other device identifiers the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage Third-Parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p>

          <p><strong>“Social Media Widgets”</strong> are social media features such as Facebook Share and Twitter Follow. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a Cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a Third-Party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
          
          <p>We use Web Technologies generally for the following purposes: </p>

          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Operationally Necessary</strong>. We may use Cookies, Web Beacons, Log Data or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Sites, Services, applications, and tools. This includes technologies that allow you access to our Sites, Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;</li>

            <li> <strong>Performance Related</strong> We may use Web Technologies to assess the performance of our Sites, applications, Services, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Sites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our Site content, applications, Services, or tools;</li>

            <li> <strong>Functionality Related</strong>. We may use Web Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Sites, Services, applications, or tools. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our Sites;

            <li> <strong>Advertising or Targeting Related</strong>. We may use first-party or Third-Party Cookies and Web Beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our sites or on Third-Party sites and to track incoming traffic from paid external campaigns. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.

          </ul>


          <p>(c) <u>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device.</u> We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</p>

          <p>(d) <u>Location Information.</u> We may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.</p>
        
          <p>(e) <u>Information Submitted Via Services.</u> You agree that News Deeply is free to use the content of any communications submitted by you via the Services, including any ideas, inventions, concepts, techniques, or know-how disclosed therein, for any purpose including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing goods or Services. News Deeply will not release your name or otherwise publicize the fact that you submitted materials or other information to us unless: (a) you grant us permission to do so; (b) we first send notice to you that the materials or other information you submit to a particular part of a Service will be published or otherwise used with your name on it; or (c) we are required to do so by law.</p>

          <p>(f) <u>Information From Other Sources.</u> We may receive information about you from other sources, including through Third-Party services and organizations to supplement information provided by you. For example, if you access our Services through a Third-Party application, such as an App Store or SNS, we may collect information about you from that Third-Party application that you have made public via your privacy settings. Information we collect through App Stores or SNS accounts may include your name, your SNS user identification number, your SNS user name, location, sex, birth date, email, profile picture, and your contacts on the SNS. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to News Deeply and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our business, products, and Services.</p>
            
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> <strong>Human Resources Data</strong>. News Deeply collects Personal Information from current, prospective, and former Employees, their contact points in case of a medical emergency, and beneficiaries under any insurance policy (<strong>“Human Resources Data”</strong>).

We may also collect Sensitive Human Resources Data such as details of health and disability, including mental health, medical leave, and maternity leave; information about national origin or immigration status; and optional demographic information such as race, which helps us achieve our diversity goals.</p>

            <p> We acquire, hold, use and Process Human Resources Data for a variety of business purposes including:</p>
