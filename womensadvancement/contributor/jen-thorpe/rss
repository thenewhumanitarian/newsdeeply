      <description>Recent studies have shown that the three-month injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera might make people more vulnerable to contracting HIV.

      <description>Until recently, South Africans faced a limit of 20 years to report sexual offenses committed against them, with the exception of rape.

      <description>South Africa has had a Domestic Violence Act since 1998, but its critics say the law is ineffective, leaving women with nowhere to turn when they try to escape abusive relationships. We speak to rights activist Claudia Lopes about what more needs to be done.</description>
