						<p><span class="start">Jahanara* had had </span> enough. For a year, the Bangladeshi cook had been working 12 to 16 hours a day, eating only leftovers and sleeping on the kitchen floor of her employer’s Abu Dhabi home – all for half the salary she had been promised. She had to prepare four fresh meals a day for the eight-member family, who gave her little rest. She was tired, she had no phone and she was alone. So, in the summer of 2014, in the middle of the night after a long day’s work, she snuck out into the driveway, scaled the front gate and&nbsp;escaped.</p>
<p>Jahanara ran along the road in the dark. She did not know where she was going. Eventually, a Pakistani taxi driver pulled over, and asked her if she had run away from her employer, and whether she needed help. She admitted she had no money, and no clue where she wanted to go. The driver gave her a ride, dropping her off in the neighboring emirate of Dubai, in the Deira neighborhood. There, he introduced her to Vijaya,* an Indian woman in her late fifties who had been working in the Gulf for more than two&nbsp;decades.</p>
<div class="post-pullquote-wide-screen-block "><p>“It’s like I found family here in this strange&nbsp;land.”</p></div>
<p>Vijaya gave the nervous young woman a meal of rice, dal and, as Jahanara still recalls, “a beautiful fish fry.” She arranged for Jahanara to rent half a room in her apartment and, within a week, had found her part-time housekeeping work in the homes of two expat&nbsp;families.</p>
<p>Jahanara is a 31-year-old single woman from north Bangladesh, and Vijaya, 60, is a grandmother of eight from Mumbai, India. Jahanara speaks Bengali, while Vijaya speaks Telugu. Despite the differences in age and background, the two women have become close friends. They communicate in gestures and broken&nbsp;Urdu.</p>
<p>“It’s like I found family here in this strange land,” Jahanara&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>The younger woman now cleans four houses a day, and cooks dinner for a fifth, while the older woman works as a masseuse, giving traditional oil massages to mothers and&nbsp;babies.</p>

</div></div>
<p class="wp-caption-text">The <span class="caps">UAE</span>, pictured here from space, runs on the labor of domestic workers. But life on the margins of a booming Gulf economy is never easy. (maps4media via Getty&nbsp;Images)</p>
<p>Jahanara’s experience in Abu Dhabi was not the first time she had been exploited as a domestic worker in the Gulf. She originally left Bangladesh six years ago, and has been home only once since then, when she ran away from abusive employers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and the police deported her. She had no choice – under the <a href="https://www.migrant-rights.org/2015/03/understanding-kafala-an-archaic-law-at-cross-purposes-with-modern-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-criticized kafala system</a> for legally employing migrant workers, a domestic worker is attached to a particular household that sponsors their visa. Employers often keep the worker’s passport to prevent their leaving, although this is illegal in most Gulf countries&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Under kafala, quitting a bad boss means losing your passport and vital work visa, and potentially being arrested or deported. This is why, the second time, Jahanara escaped in the dead of night. Now, she works outside official&nbsp;channels.</p>
<p>“You earn at least three times more if you’re ‘khalli walli,’” Vijaya says, using a colloquial Arabic term for undocumented or freelance migrant workers. The name loosely translates as “take it or leave&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>“You get to sleep in your own house, you get paid on time and if your employer misbehaves, you can find a new one,” she&nbsp;says.</p>
<div class="post-pullquote-wide-screen-block "><p>“The Gulf needs us, but like a bad husband, it also exploits&nbsp;us.”</p></div>
<p>Ever year, driven by poverty, family pressure, conflict or natural disasters back home, millions of women, mainly from developing countries, get on flights to the Gulf with their fingers crossed that they won’t be abused when they get&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>It’s a dangerous trade-off, but one that can work out for some. When Jahanara and Vijaya describe their lives, the two women repeatedly weigh the possibility of financial empowerment against inadequate wages, routine abuse and&nbsp;vulnerability.</p>
<p>By working for 23 years in Dubai and Muscat in Oman, Vijaya has funded the education of her three children, the construction of a house for her son in a Mumbai slum and the weddings of two daughters. She is overworked and underpaid, but she says that’s “normal.” As she sees it, it’s all part of working on the margins of one of the world’s most successful&nbsp;economies.</p>
<p>“The Gulf needs us,” Vijaya says. “But like a bad husband, it also exploits&nbsp;us.”</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Demand for domestic work in Dubai and other Gulf cities has remained high, despite economic downturns in the region. (Getty&nbsp;Images)</p>
<p>The International Labour Organization (<span class="caps">ILO</span>) reports that there are <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/briefingnote/wcms_490162.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="caps">11.5</span> million migrant domestic workers</a> around the world – 73 percent of them are women. In 2016, <a href="http://abudhabidialogue.org.ae/sites/default/files/document-library/2018_Future of Domestic Work Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there were <span class="caps">3.77</span> million</a> domestic workers in Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council&nbsp;(<span class="caps">GCC</span>).</p>
<p>In a single household in these states, it’s common to find several domestic workers employed to do everything from cleaning and cooking, to guarding the home and tutoring the&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>Unlike other sectors, the demand for domestic workers has been resilient to economic downturns. Estimated to be one of the <a href="http://abudhabidialogue.org.ae/sites/default/files/document-library/2018_Future of Domestic Work Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world’s largest employers</a> of domestic workers, Saudi Arabia hosts around <span class="caps">2.42</span> million. The majority of these workers (733,000) entered the country between 2016 and 2017, during its fiscal deficit. In 2017, domestic workers comprised a full <a href="http://abudhabidialogue.org.ae/sites/default/files/document-library/2018_Future of Domestic Work Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 percent of Kuwait’s</a> working age population. Oman has seen a threefold explosion in its domestic work sector since 2008. Overall, the <span class="caps">GCC</span>’s migrant domestic work sector has been growing at an annual average of <a href="http://abudhabidialogue.org.ae/sites/default/files/document-library/2018 ADD SOM - Future of Domestic Work Report -min.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="caps">8.7</span> percent</a> for the past&nbsp;decade.</p>
<p>That growth is partly fueled by the increasing numbers of women entering the workforce. The percentage of Saudi Arabia’s adult female population in the formal labor force <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS?end=2017&amp;start=2007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has risen from 18 percent to 22 percent</a> over the past decade. In Qatar, the figure has jumped from 49 percent to 58 percent. And as more women go to work, there’s a growing need for others to take over the child and elderly care in their households. Experts call this transfer of care work from unpaid family members to paid workers from other countries the “<a href="https://trainingcentre.unwomen.org/instraw-library/2009-R-MIG-GLO-GLO-EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global care chain</a>.”</p>
<div class="left-side-quote-block "><p>“I have a Pakistani driver, an Indonesian cook, an Indian cleaner, a Filipino home nurse and a Sri Lankan nanny. None of them speaks Arabic, and they can hardly speak to each other, but they run my household like a well-oiled&nbsp;machine.”</p></div>
<p>A 2017 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702386/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, which examined the effect of changing demographics in the Gulf, found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702386/figure/Fig6/?report=objectonly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatically decreased fertility</a> – thanks to improved female education and later marriages – and greater numbers of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702386/figure/Fig8/?report=objectonly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dependent elderly</a> have resulted in an “increased trend for labour participation of ‘traditional’ informal care givers (usually&nbsp;women).”</p>
<p>The enduring use of migrant domestic workers in the region is also a result of <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/briefingnote/wcms_490162.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local traditions</a>. For example, while Saudi Arabia was still the only country in the world that banned women from driving, there was a consistent need for male personal drivers, many coming from abroad. The ban was lifted in June 2018, but the demand for drivers is still high because many women don’t yet have&nbsp;licenses.</p>
<p>“Without domestic workers, societies could not function here,” says Mohammed Abu Baker, a lawyer in Abu Dhabi and a <span class="caps">UAE</span> national. “I was brought up by many Indian nannies, at a time when Indians were our primary migrants. Now, I have a Pakistani driver, an Indonesian cook, an Indian cleaner, a Filipino home nurse and a Sri Lankan nanny. None of them speak Arabic, and they can hardly speak to each other, but they run my household like a well-oiled&nbsp;machine.”</p>
<p>There is also demand from expatriate families, with dual wage earners looking for professional cleaning services, part-time cooks and full-time childcare&nbsp;workers.</p>
<p>“When I came from Seattle with my husband, we were determined not to hire servants,” says Laura*, a 35-year-old teacher in an American primary school in Abu Dhabi. “But after we got pregnant, and I got my teaching job, we had to get full-time&nbsp;help.”</p>
<p>“My American guilt about hiring house help disappeared in months!” she says, as her Sri Lankan cook Frida quietly passes around home-baked cookies. “It is impossible to imagine these conveniences back home, at this&nbsp;price.”</p>
<p>Laura says she pays minimum wage, and funds Frida’s medical insurance – “all as per law.” But she also knows that conveniences for women like her often come at a cost paid by women like Frida. As part of her local church’s “good Samaritan group” – as social workers must call themselves to avoid government scrutiny – Laura has helped fundraise medical and legal expenses for at least 40 abused migrant workers over the past two&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>Living isolated in a house with limited mobility and no community, many domestic workers, especially women, are vulnerable to abuse. Afraid to lose their right to work, employees can endure a lot before running away, including serious sexual assault. Legal provisions do exist – in many countries, workers can file a criminal complaint against their employers, or approach labor courts for help. But often they are unaware of, or unable to access, the existing labor protections and&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>“I never believed the horror stories before, but when you meet woman after woman with bruises or unpaid wages, you start understanding that the same system that makes my life easier is actually broken,” Laura&nbsp;says.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Finding work in the aftermath of Sri Lanka’s civil war has been hard for Tamil widows in the country’s north. Work is not easy to find, and many women are expected to stay in their homes, despite having families to feed. (Ishara S. Kodikara/<span class="caps">AFP</span>/Getty&nbsp;Images)</p>
<p>In 2007, Jayatri* made one of the hardest decisions of her life. She left her two young children at home in Sri Lanka, while the country was at war, to be with another family in Saudi&nbsp;Arabia.</p>
<p>It was near the end of Sri Lanka’s protracted civil war and 22-year-old Jayatri had been struggling to support her family since her husband’s death in the war two years earlier. The 26-year conflict claimed the lives of tens of thousands of fathers, husbands, sons and brothers, forcing many Tamil women to take on the role of sole breadwinner for their families. But there are few job opportunities for women in a culture that still largely believes their place is in the home. Women who are single or widowed already face stigma, which only gets worse if they also try to find paying work in Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p>
<div class="left-side-quote-block "><p>“I never believed the horror stories before, but when you meet woman after woman with bruises or unpaid wages, you start understanding that the same system that makes my life easier, is actually&nbsp;broken.”</p></div>
<p>S. Senthurajah, executive director of <span class="caps">SOND</span>, an organization that raises awareness about safe migration, says that as a result, an increasing number of women are migrating from Sri Lanka to the Gulf. More than <a href="http://publications.iom.int/system/files/pdf/mpi_issue12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">160,000 Sri Lankan women</a> leave home annually to work in other countries, including the <span class="caps">UAE</span>, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Malaysia, according to the International Organization for&nbsp;Migration.</p>
<p>Senthurajah says recruitment agencies specifically target vulnerable female heads of households: widows, single and divorced women and women whose husbands are disabled or otherwise unable to work to support the family. Women like&nbsp;Jayatri.</p>
<p>When a local recruitment agency approached her and offered her a job as a domestic worker in the Gulf, it was an opportunity she felt she couldn’t turn down. She traveled from Vavuniya, a town in the island’s north – which was then under the control of Tamil Tiger rebels – to Colombo, to undergo a few weeks of housekeeping&nbsp;training.</p>
<p>She left her young children, a boy and a girl, with her mother. When she eventually arrived in Saudi Arabia, her passport was taken by the local recruitment agency and she was driven to her new home where there were 15 children to look after. From the start, she was&nbsp;abused.</p>
<p>“I spent five months in that house being tortured, hit and with no proper food and no salary. I worked from 5 a.m. to midnight every day,” she says, not wanting to divulge any more details about how she was&nbsp;treated.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to go&nbsp;home.”</p>
<p>Jayatri complained repeatedly to the recruitment agency, who insisted that she’d signed a contract for two years and that there was no way out. She was eventually transferred to another home, but the situation there was just as bad: She worked 18 hours a day and was abused,&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“It was like jail,” she&nbsp;says.</p>
<div class="post-pullquote-wide-screen-block "><p>“I spent five months in that house being tortured, hit and with no proper food and no salary. I worked from 5 a.m. to midnight every&nbsp;day.”</p></div>
<p>In 2009, Jayatri arrived back in northern Sri Lanka with nothing to show for what she had endured in Saudi Arabia. She was never paid for either job. She now works as a housemaid in Vavuniya earning $60 per month. It’s not&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>“This is the only opportunity I have,” she says. “There’s no support. There are so many difficulties&nbsp;here.”</p>
<p>Jayatri’s traumatic time in Saudi Arabia is one of <a href="https://menafn.com/1097267639/Maid-pleads-for-help-on-social-media-after-suffering-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many stories of abuse</a> that have come out of the country in recent years. While there are no reliable statistics on the number of migrant domestic workers who suffer abuse at the hands of their employers, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/07/08/saudi-arabia-domestic-workers-face-harsh-abuses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human Rights Watch</a> says that each year the Saudi Ministry of Social Affairs and the embassies of source countries shelter thousands of domestic workers with complaints against their employers or&nbsp;recruiters.</p>
<p>Excessive workload and unpaid wages are the <a href="https://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/slavery/fmd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most common</a> complaints. But employers largely act with impunity, Senthurajah&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>“It’s like a human slave sale,” Ravindra De Silva, cofounder of <a href="https://afrielyouthnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="caps">AFRIEL</span></a>, an organization that works with returnee migrant workers in northern Sri Lanka, tells News&nbsp;Deeply.</p>
<p>“Recruitment agencies have agents in different regions of the country and through those agents, they collect women as a group and send them. The agents know which families [to] pick easily – widows and those with financial difficulties,” he&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>In 2016, a man turned up at Meera’s* mud-brick home on the outskirts of Jaffna, the capital of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province, offering her a job in the&nbsp;Gulf.</p>
<div class="left-side-quote-block "><p>“Recruitment agencies have agents in different regions of the country and through those agents, they collect women as a group and send them. The agents know which families [to] pick easily – widows and those with financial&nbsp;difficulties”</p></div>
<p>“They told me I could earn well if I went abroad and that they could help me to look after my family,” she&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>Within a few months of arriving in Saudi Arabia, Meera, 42, couldn’t keep up with the long hours and strenuous housework. She cooked and cleaned for 12 family members and rarely got a&nbsp;break.</p>
<p>Her employer then became&nbsp;abusive.</p>
<p>“He started beating me and put acid in my eyes,” she says. He also sexually assaulted&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>But she endured the attacks and mistreatment, holding on to the hope of making enough money to secure her family’s future. After eight months, she went back home. She was never&nbsp;paid.</p>
<p>Now Meera makes ends meet by working as a day laborer. “The agency keeps coming back, telling me how poor we are and that I should go back [to Saudi Arabia] for my children,” she&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>“I’ll never go back again. I got nothing from it, [except] now I can’t see properly because of the acid in my&nbsp;eyes.”</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">More than 1,500 people leave Nepal in search of work overseas every day. The remittances they send home are a vital part of the economy. (Prakash Mathema/<span class="caps">AFP</span>/Getty&nbsp;Images)</p>
<p>While thousands of women travel to a foreign country for work and end up exploited and abused, there are also those who make the journey and find what they were looking for: opportunity and self-reliance. Every day, more than 1,500 Nepalis leave the country for employment abroad, primarily in Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, India and Malaysia. Of the estimated <span class="caps">2.5</span> million Nepalis working overseas, about 11 percent are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5774120/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">female</a>.</p>
<p>Many women from South Asian countries who work in the Gulf send remittances home that are used to improve their family’s socio-economic status, covering the cost of <a href="http://publications.iom.int/system/files/pdf/mpi_issue12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education</a>, health care, food and housing. In addition to financial remittances, the social remittances of female migrants in terms of skills, attitudes, ideas and knowledge can also have <a href="http://www.caritas.org/includes/pdf/backgroundmigration.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide-ranging benefits</a>, including contributing to economic development and gender equality back&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>Kunan Gurung, project coordinator at <a href="http://www.pourakhi.org.np/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pourakhi Nepal</a>, an organization focused on supporting female returnee migrants, says those who have “successful” migration journeys are often able to use their experiences abroad to challenge gender&nbsp;norms.</p>
<div class="left-side-quote-block "><p>“Our society is patriarchal and male-dominated, but the boundaries expand for women who return from the Gulf successfully because they have money and thus some&nbsp;power.”</p></div>
<p>“Our society is patriarchal and male-dominated, but the boundaries expand for women who return from the Gulf successfully because they have money and thus some power,” he&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>“The women have left their village, taken a plane and have lived in the developed world. Such experiences leave them feeling&nbsp;empowered.”</p>
<p>Gurung says many returning migrant workers invest their savings in their own businesses, from tailoring to chicken farms. But it can be difficult, because women often find that the skills they earned while working abroad can’t help them make money back home. To counter this, Pourakhi trains women in entrepreneurship to not only try to limit re-migration and keep families together but also to ensure women are equipped with tangible skills in the context of life in&nbsp;Nepal.</p>
<p>But for the women in Nepal who, like Jayatri in Sri Lanka, return without having earned any money, deep-rooted stigma can block their chances to work and separate them from their families. Women who come home with nothing are looked at with suspicion and accused of being sexually active, Gurung&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>“The reality is that women are not looked after in the Gulf, in most cases,” he&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>In Kathmandu, Pourakhi runs an emergency shelter for returning female migrants. Every evening, staff wait at Kathmandu airport for flights landing from the Gulf. They approach returning migrants – women who stand out because of their conservative clothes and “the look on their faces” – and offer shelter, food and&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>Of the 2,000 women they have housed over the last nine years, 42 have returned pregnant and 21 with&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>“There are so many problems returnee migrants face. Most women don’t have contact with their families because their employer didn’t pay, or they have health issues or they’re pregnant,” says Krishna Gurung (no relation to Kunan), Pourakhi’s shelter&nbsp;manager.</p>
<p>“They don’t reintegrate with their families. Their families don’t accept them.” Which could be the biggest tragedy of all. Because the chance to make life better for their families is what drives so many women to leave home in the first&nbsp;place.</p>

<p>Realizing how crucial their workers are to the Gulf economies, major labor-sending countries such as Nepal, Bangladesh, India and the Philippines have been using both pressure and dialogue to improve conditions for their&nbsp;citizens.</p>
<p>Over recent years, they have instituted a wide array of bans and restrictions, often linked to particularly horrifying cases of abuse. Nepal has <a href="../../06/20/why-women-defy-nepals-travel-ban-to-take-on-domestic-work-overseas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned women</a> from working in the Gulf in 2016; the same year, India disallowed women <a href="https://gulfnews.com/news/asia/india/young-women-bypass-india-s-strict-emigration-system-1.2073849" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under 30</a> from migrating to the Gulf. In 2013, Sri Lanka <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/01/20131252517879813.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily banned</a> women from leaving the country for domestic work, citing abuse abroad and neglected families at home, and now requires a family background report before women can&nbsp;travel.</p>
<p>The most high-profile <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/03/how-a-maid-found-dead-in-a-freezer-set-off-a-diplomatic-clash-between-the-philippines-and-kuwait/?utm_term=.a93a4057f7c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diplomatic dispute</a> over domestic workers unfolded between the Philippines and Kuwait this year. In January, the Philippines banned workers from going to Kuwait, and made the ban “permanent” in February after a 29-year-old Filipino maid, Joanna Demafelis, was found dead in a freezer in her employers’ abandoned apartment in Kuwait&nbsp;City.</p>
<div class="post-pullquote-wide-screen-block "><p>“Bans provide some political leverage for the sending&nbsp;country.”</p></div>
<p>At the time, the Philippines’ firebrand president, Rodrigo Duterte, said he would “<a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/02/14/1787601/duterte-ready-sell-soul-devil-ofws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell my soul to the devil</a>” to get his citizens home from Kuwait to live comfortably back home. Thousands of Filipino citizens were repatriated through a voluntary return scheme in the first half of 2018, while Kuwait made <a href="../../../../executive-summaries/2018/04/06.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overtures</a> to Ethiopia to recruit more maids to replace the lost labor force. Duterte’s ban was eventually <a href="http://cnnphilippines.com/incoming/2018/05/13/OFW-Kuwait-Philippines-labor-deal-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifted in May</a>, after Kuwait agreed to reform its migrant work sector, ending the seizure of passports and phones, and instituting a 24-hour hotline for abused&nbsp;workers.</p>
<p>It’s well established that bans do not stop women from traveling to the Gulf to become domestic workers. Bandana Pattanaik, the international coordinator of the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, has criticized bans as being “patriarchal, limiting to female agency and also ending up encouraging illegal human&nbsp;smuggling.”</p>
<p>But others point out that the international pressure generated by travel bans has had some effect, as in the case with the Philippines and Kuwait. “Bans provide some political leverage for the sending country,” says Kathmandu-based researcher Upasana Khadka. “But bans do not work as permanent&nbsp;solutions.”</p>

<p>Today, after decades of criticism and campaigning around labor rights violations, the Gulf is seeing a slow shift toward building better policies for domestic&nbsp;workers.</p>
<p>“In the past five years, five of the six <span class="caps">GCC</span> countries have started to adopt laws for the protection of migrant domestic workers for the very first time,” says Rothna Begum, women’s rights researcher for Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights&nbsp;Watch.</p>
<p>“The <span class="caps">GCC</span> countries have long cultivated the image of being luxurious economies meant for the good life,” Begum says. “This image is hard to maintain as labor exploitation comes to light. So, while they try to shut the reporting down, they have also been forced to address some of the issues raised by their&nbsp;critics.”</p>
<p>Legal and institutional reforms have been announced in the domestic work sector in all <span class="caps">GCC</span> countries except Oman. These regulate and standardize contracts, mandate better living conditions, formalize recruitment, and plan rehabilitation and legal redress for abused&nbsp;workers.</p>
<p>This gradual reform is due to international pressure and monitoring by human rights groups and international worker unions. After the 2014 crash in the oil economy, the sudden need for foreign investment exposed the <span class="caps">GCC</span> and the multinational companies doing business there to more global&nbsp;scrutiny.</p>
<p>Countries in the Gulf are also hoping that the new national policies will attract more professional and skilled home workers. “Domestic work is a corrupt, messy sector. The host countries are trying to make it more professional,” says M. Bheem Reddy, vice president of the Hyderabad-based Migrant Rights Council, which engages with women workers from the southern districts of&nbsp;India.</p>
<div class="left-side-quote-block "><p>“The <span class="caps">GCC</span> countries have for long cultivated the image of being luxurious economies meant for the good life. This image is hard to maintain as labor exploitation comes to&nbsp;light.”</p></div>
<p>Many of the Gulf states are moving toward nationalization – creating more space for their own citizens in the private sector – this means they also want to regulate one of the fastest growing job sectors in the region. “This starts with dignity and proper pay for the existing migrant workers,” Reddy&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>There have been attempts to develop a regional standard for domestic labor rights, with little success. In 2011, the <span class="caps">ILO</span> set standards on decent work and minimum protection through the landmark <a href="http://ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domestic Workers Convention</a>. All the <span class="caps">GCC</span> countries adopted the Convention, but none have ratified it, which means the rules are not&nbsp;binding.</p>
<p>Instead, each Gulf country has taken its own steps to try to protect household workers who come from&nbsp;abroad.</p>
<p>After reports of forced labor in the lead-up to the 2022 <span class="caps">FIFA</span> World Cup, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/un-gives-qatar-year-end-forced-labour-migrant-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qatar faced a formal inquiry by the <span class="caps">ILO</span></a> if it didn’t put in place migrant labor protections. Under that pressure, in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qatar-rights-idUSKCN1B40XO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017, the country passed a law</a> on domestic work. The law stipulates free health care, a regular monthly salary, maximum 10-hour work days, and three weeks’ severance pay. Later, it set a temporary minimum wage for migrant workers, at $200 a&nbsp;month.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">UAE</span>’s new reforms are motivated by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/gulf-crisis-started-180531140250121.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Gulf crisis</a> – which has seen Qatar blockaded by its neighbors – as well as a desire to be seen as one of the more progressive <span class="caps">GCC</span> countries. The <span class="caps">UAE</span> had a draft law on domestic work since 2012, but only passed it in 2017, after Kuwait published its own law. The royal decree gives household workers a regular weekly day off, daily rest of at least 12 hours, access to a mobile phone, 30 days paid annual leave and the right to retain personal documents like passports. Most importantly, it has moved domestic work from the purview of the interior ministry to the labor ministry – a long-standing demand from rights&nbsp;advocates.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">UAE</span> has also become the first Gulf country to allow inspectors access to a household after securing a warrant from the prosecutor. This process would be triggered by a worker’s distress call or complaint, but it’s unclear if regular state inspections will also occur. Before this law, says Begum, the biggest obstacle to enforcing labor protection in domestic work was the inability for authorities to monitor the workspace of a cleaner or cook, because it is a private home, unlike a hotel or a construction&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">UAE</span> has not followed Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia in stipulating a minimum wage for domestic workers. But it has issued licenses for 40 <a href="http://www.mohre.gov.ae/assets/8ba1d1a1/tadbeer-service-centers.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tadbeer Service Centers</a>, which will replace recruitment agencies by the end of the year. Employers in the <span class="caps">UAE</span> will have to submit their requests for workers through these centers, which are run by private licensed agents but supervised by the Ministry of Human Resources. Each of the centers has accommodation for workers and can also sponsor their visas, freeing them up to take on part-time jobs while also catering to growing demand from <span class="caps">UAE</span> nationals and expats for legal&nbsp;part-timers.</p>
<div class="post-pullquote-wide-screen-block "><p>“You focus on the success stories you hear, and hope you’ll have that&nbsp;luck.”</p></div>
<p>B. L. Surendranath, general secretary of the Immigration Protection Center in Hyderabad, India, visited some of these centers in Dubai earlier this year, on the invitation of the <span class="caps">UAE</span> human resources ministry. “I was pleasantly surprised at the well-thought-out ideas at the model Tadbeer Center,” he says. “Half the conflicts [between employer and worker] are because of miscommunication, which the center will sort out through conflict resolution&nbsp;counselors.”</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia passed a labor law in 2015, but it didn’t extend to domestic work. Now, as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df579534-47c3-11e8-8ae9-4b5ddcca99b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unemployment among its nationals</a> touches a high of <span class="caps">12.8</span> percent, its efforts to create more jobs include regulating the migrant workforce. The Saudi government has launched an electronic platform called Musaned to directly hire migrant domestic workers, cutting out recruitment agencies altogether. Women migrant workers will soon live in dormitories and hostels run by labor supply agencies, not the homes of their employers. The labor ministry has also launched a multi-language hotline for domestic workers to lodge&nbsp;complaints.</p>
<p>Dhaka-based migrant rights activist Shakirul Islam, from Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Programme, welcomes these changes, but remains circumspect. “Most women who return to Bangladesh from Saudi [Arabia] say that the revised laws have no impact on their lives,” he says. “My understanding is that the employers are not aware of the law on the one hand, and on the other, do not care about&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>Migrant rights activists, <span class="caps">ILO</span> officials, the governments of source countries and workers themselves are cautiously optimistic about the progressive direction of reforms in the Gulf. “But it is clear that none of the laws penalize employers of domestic workers for labor rights violations,” says&nbsp;Islam.</p>
<p>Rights activists and reports from the <span class="caps">ILO</span>, <span class="caps">U.N.</span> and migrants’ rights forums have for decades repeated that full protection of domestic workers is impossible as long as <span class="caps">GCC</span> countries continue to have some form of the kafala sponsorship&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia continues to require workers to secure an exit permit from their employers if they want to leave the country, while Qatar’s 2015 law to replace the kafala sponsorship system does not extend to domestic workers. Reddy of the Migrant Rights Council says the <span class="caps">UAE</span>’s attempt to tackle kafala by allowing Tadbeer Center agents to sponsor visas does not make agents accountable if they repeatedly send different workers to the same abusive&nbsp;employer.</p>
<p>For now, it seems the women working on the margins of some of the richest economies in the world will remain vulnerable to abuse and exploitation from their employers. And as long as opportunities exist for them in the Gulf that they can’t find at home, thousands will come to fulfil the demand for domestic and care work, knowing they could be risking everything for little or no&nbsp;return.</p>
<p>Jahanara says the only thing for women in her position to do is to take the chance and hope for the&nbsp;best.</p>
<p>“You focus on the success stories you hear, and hope you’ll have that&nbsp;luck.”</p>
