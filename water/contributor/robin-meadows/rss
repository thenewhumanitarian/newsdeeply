      <description>Delta smelt have become so rare in the wild now that a mere six adults were found during a sample survey of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta carried out last spring. That’s why the U.C. Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Laboratory has a backup plan.</description>

      <description>Microplastics found in fabrics and cosmetics accumulate in fish tissue, absorb pollutants and may harm human health. Studies estimate the United States dumps 8 trillion microbeads into its waters every day. The problem is particularly acute in San Francisco Bay, where water flushes out slowly.</description>
