      <description>Research has found that wind is on the decline in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which subsequently impacts the turbidity of the water. That in turn has an impact on critically endangered delta smelt, writes Metropolitan Water District’s Tom Philp.</description>

      <title>The Fight Over ‘Big Gulp, Little Sip’</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://www.newsdeeply.com/water/community/2016/03/29/the-fight-over-big-gulp-little-sip</guid>
      <description>Many people agree that “Big Gulp, Little Sip” is a good way to manage water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, but fewer agree what actually constitutes a “Big Gulp.” California WaterFix could help ease tensions over this problem by providing more flexibility in water diversions from the Delta.</description>

      <description>We are bound to have the same problems this time nearly every year in the Delta until we modernize this water system and start capturing water north of smelt territory, as proposed by state and federal agencies via the plan known as California WaterFix.</description>
