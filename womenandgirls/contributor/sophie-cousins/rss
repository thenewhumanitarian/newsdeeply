      <description>Abortion is illegal in almost all cases in Sri Lanka, but it’s perfectly legal for women to seek help after complications from backstreet abortions. Still, the fear of stigma and discrimination prevents many from coming forward.</description>

      <description>Nepal has banned the practice of banishing menstruating women and girls to sheds. Activists have welcomed the new law, but say there is more work to be done to change people’s minds about the tradition, which has led to a number of deaths in recent years. </description>

      <description>The effects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s banknote ban on India’s informal economy – from sex trafficking to corruption – are not yet clear, but in Old Delhi, one woman is breaking the cycle of forced sex work with education instead.</description>

      <description>In India, women who suffer from tuberculosis often face discrimination and social isolation – something that doesn’t happen to men with the disease. Ahead of World TB Day on March 24, female TB survivors are breaking their silence in the hopes of changing attitudes toward the illness.</description>

      <description>In sub-Saharan Africa, girls and young women account for 71 percent of new HIV infections among adolescents. South African officials hope more access to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, will help, but experts say stigma and lack of education could doom those efforts.</description>
