      <description>Heavy fuel oil turns into a mayonnaise-like goop in Arctic waters and is exceedingly difficult to clean up. The U.S. and Canada have pledged to curb its use, but other Arctic nations – particularly Russia – aren’t ready to switch to pricier alternatives yet.</description>

      <description>Shipping in Arctic waters is expected to rise as sea ice thins and melts, particularly along Russia’s Northern Sea Route. Bernice Notenboom’s new film Sea Blind looks at the risks and environmental costs involved in Arctic shipping  – and plots a path towards a more sustainable industry.</description>

      <title>A Better Way to Build Icebreakers: Collaboration</title>

      <guid>https://www.newsdeeply.com/arctic/community/2016/02/11/a-better-way-to-build-icebreakers-collaboration</guid>
      <description>Why pay more than $1 billion for a new icebreaker when it costs $150 million to make one in Finland – and where they are used for only part of the year? Canada, the U.S. and Finland could share these vessels, a joint venture that would increase the number of much-needed ice-ready ships in the changing Arctic.</description>

      <description>As the climate warms, Arctic shipping routes are expected to remain open for longer, which could save companies time and money. Scott Stephenson, a geographer at the University of Connecticut, charts the future of these shipping lanes.</description>

      <description>HAKAI MAGAZINE: As summer sea ice recedes and resource development grows, the number of ships in the Arctic may well increase and bring with them non-native aquatic species. In fact, some have already made it to the Arctic, they just can’t survive there - yet.</description>

      <description>Black carbon, also known as soot, has an important role in global warming, especially in the Arctic. When it’s in the atmosphere, it traps heat, and when it falls on snow or ice, it speeds up melting. Curbing black carbon emissions could help slow down the planet’s warming.</description>

      <description>Passenger and cargo ships traveling in Antarctic waters are prohibited from using, or carrying, heavy fuel oil – but not in the Arctic. This inexpensive fuel emits powerful climate forcers and poses a significant threat to the marine environment, particularly in colder waters, writes Laura Strickler.</description>

      <description>Satellites orbiting the Earth can spot signs of human activity during the dark polar night. These light-sensitive new technologies keep tabs on development, add security to Arctic maritime activities and can even be used to detect illicit activity, writes Mia Bennett.</description>
