      <description>Without a high-speed fiber-optic link, Nunavut remains dependent on a sluggish, satellite-based internet service. That’s increasingly a problem for the territory’s economy and government, says Madeleine Redfern, the mayor of Nunavut’s capital, Iqaluit.</description>

      <description>Foreign tourists helped Iceland back on its feet after its economy bottomed out. Canada’s Arctic is just as stunning and culturally rich, but it still lacks easy transportation, hotels and other amenities for tourism to give the region an economic boost.</description>
