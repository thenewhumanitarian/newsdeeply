      <description>Greenland, a former Danish colony that moved closer to independence after a new law on self-government came into effect in 2009, has ambitions to open up its territory to mining, oil and gas development and tourism. Its aim is to boost its economy, reduce unemployment – and reduce its reliance on Denmark.</description>
