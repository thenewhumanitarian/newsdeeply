    <title>Oceans contributor: Jodi Brandt</title>
    <description>Jodi Brandt joined the Human-Environment Systems Research Center at Boise State University in 2015. The goal of her research is to better understand how human societies and healthy ecosystems can thrive, on a rapidly changing planet. She focuses on quantifying human-environment interactions and whether they create sustainable environmental trajectories. She works with a wide range of people, including economists, ecologists and anthropologists, farmers, hunters and tribal communities. She has worked in several of the most special places on Earth, including the High Himalaya, tropical forests in the Congo, the Bolivian Andes and the shorelines of Lake Superior.
