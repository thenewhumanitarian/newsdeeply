    <description>Stephen Nicol has spent his scientific career working with krill in the Antarctic as well as in Canada and South Africa. He has published extensively on many aspects of krill biology, on the management of the krill fishery, on the Southern Ocean ecosystem as well as on more esoteric aspects of human interactions with krill. He worked for the Australian Government’s Antarctic Division for 24 years as a research scientist and program leader. During that time, he also served on Australia’s delegation to the international commission that manages Antarctica’s fisheries.
