    <description>Dr. Max Liboiron is an assistant professor in geography at Memorial University of Newfoundland, where she directs the Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research (CLEAR), a feminist laboratory that studies marine plastic pollution. Liboiron’s research bridges the natural and social sciences in its investigation of how harmful yet invisible threats such as toxicants and marine plastics become visible in science and activism, and how these methods of representation relate to action.
