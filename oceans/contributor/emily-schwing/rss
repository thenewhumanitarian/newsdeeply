      <description>The U.S. Marine Mammal Commission flew to the Arctic for first time in almost 30 years to listen to Alaska’s coastal hunters talk about climate change and the health of seals, walrus and other marine mammals. But will what they heard translate into new policies and conservation efforts?</description>

      <description>The impact of climate change on Arctic communities is so great that it limits their ability to adapt, or at least that’s what has long been assumed. But according to a recent study in Nature Climate Change, it’s non-climatic factors that obstruct adaptation.</description>
