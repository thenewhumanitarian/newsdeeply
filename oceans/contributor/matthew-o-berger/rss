      <description>In a lab, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy recently produced 5g of yellowcake from uranium collected from the ocean. Scientists hope to test the technology in the Gulf of Mexico next – but it is still far from being commercially viable.</description>

      <description>Researchers have found that the top layer of coral reefs prevents $4 billion in flood damage annually by breaking up waves that propel destructive storm surges. As storms increase in frequency and force, reefs play a crucial role in protecting coastal property.</description>

      <description>Since California imposed clean air restrictions on vessels that travel through state waters, the number of fatal collisions with the big marine mammals has fallen as captains slow down. But much more needs to be done to reduce ship strikes, marine biologists say.</description>

      <description>Scientists have identified a ‘biogeographic boundary’ for commercially valuable marine animals in the northwest Atlantic that divides genetically distinct populations of the same species. As temperatures rise, that dividing line is moving north.</description>

      <description>The Revillagigedo Archipelago National Park puts 57,176 square miles of the Pacific Ocean off limits to commercial fishing – and comes with funding to enforce the ban. But patrolling an area the size of Illinois, which is rich in unique marine life, will be a challenge.</description>
