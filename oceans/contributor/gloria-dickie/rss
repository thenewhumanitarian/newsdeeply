      <description>As Arctic snows melt earlier in the year, insects are emerging ahead of schedule. That’s bad news for some migratory songbirds, such as the red knot, that depend on the bugs as fuel before their long flights south.</description>

      <description>Warmer temperatures mean the Canadian High Arctic’s shallow lakes are no longer freezing to the bottom, allowing tiny creatures to thrive. Researchers predict these new conditions will be inhospitable to fish and will produce more greenhouse gases.</description>
