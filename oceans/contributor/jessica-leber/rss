      <description>NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch is in the midst of a global project to collect data and assess damage from marine heatwaves that devastated coral reefs worldwide. Scientists hope the data will improve future forecasts, helping ecologists take action before temperature spikes.</description>

      <description>Last year, a bold initiative set out to locate coral reefs most likely to survive global warming. That turned out to be far easier said than done – but now scientists hope the results will rally attention to regions where there’s hope to save crucial marine ecosystems.</description>
