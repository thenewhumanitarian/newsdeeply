      <description>NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch is in the midst of a global project to collect data and assess damage from marine heatwaves that devastated coral reefs worldwide. Scientists hope the data will improve future forecasts, helping ecologists take action before temperature spikes.</description>

      <description>An extensive survey of the Great Barrier Reef finds that a spike in ocean temperatures in 2016 led to a fall in populations of parrotfish, which keep corals healthy and help them recover from bleaching events by eating harmful algae.</description>

      <description>New research shows that snails that prey on coral play a bigger role than realized in coral health. But the good news is that reducing fishing can help keep snail populations in check.</description>

      <description>Last year, a bold initiative set out to locate coral reefs most likely to survive global warming. That turned out to be far easier said than done – but now scientists hope the results will rally attention to regions where there’s hope to save crucial marine ecosystems.</description>

      <description>In the wake of catastrophic bleaching events, scientists find that coral cover on the world’s biggest reef system is near record lows, while other research shows recovery will be “slow and painful” as only a tiny number of coral larvae are repopulating devastated reefs.</description>

      <description>In India’s Gulf of Mannar, more than a decade of efforts have spurred a slow recovery of coral reefs that protect the coast and feed communities. But climate change has reversed that success.</description>
