      <description>Marine mammals, sea turtles and other species don’t always stay within the boundaries of ocean reserves. Two scientists say marine preserves should be designed with enough flexibility to extend protections to where animals migrate.</description>

      <description>Sound not vision: Hydroacoustics allowed a single researcher to survey the fish population of a 17,600-acre preserve in Mexico in days. The technology could help small island states that are creating big marine protected areas but lack the resources to monitor them.</description>

      <description>The Revillagigedo Archipelago National Park puts 57,176 square miles of the Pacific Ocean off limits to commercial fishing – and comes with funding to enforce the ban. But patrolling an area the size of Illinois, which is rich in unique marine life, will be a challenge.</description>

      <description>More than 1,200 scientists from 45 countries have signed a petition calling on the Australian government to reverse a proposal to allow commercial fishing in marine protected areas, calling the action scientifically flawed.</description>

      <description>Scientists and policymakers say it’s not enough to create huge marine protected areas – ocean reserves must effectively limit fishing and other human activities to avoid becoming ‘paper parks.’</description>
