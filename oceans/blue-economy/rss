      <description>Aquaculture proponents view the ocean off Southern California as an ideal place for an emerging industry. The key, new research found, will be to carefully locate facilities to minimize environmental risks and conflicts with other marine uses.</description>

      <description>In the latest installment of Deeply Talks, we discuss the world’s first insurance policy for a coral reef with experts at the Nature Conservancy. In Mexico, the policy will pay for coral reef restoration when destructive hurricanes strike.</description>

      <description>After years of work to bring oysters back, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation found funding and interest harder to maintain, says scientist Chris Moore. So it helped form a new partnership that aims to plant 10 billion oysters by 2025 and grow a bigger oyster-farming industry.</description>

      <description>Famed Chinook salmon are getting smaller, according to a new study analyzing 40 years of data. The research feeds a debate over who or what is shrinking the salmon – people or other predators – and what it means for efforts to save both endangered fish and marine mammals.</description>

      <description>Thirty years of controversy has followed the transgenic technology that produces fast-growing fish but now it has finally arrived in Canada and could soon come to the United States. Will it live up to its claims of making seafood more sustainable?</description>

      <description>Tropical coastal mangroves are increasingly found in the world’s temperate zones. Samantha Chapman, a biologist at Villanova University, explains how her research has documented their dramatic growth into Florida’s salt marsh turf and why that raises questions about the future of coastlines.</description>

      <description>Scientists have attributed an algal bloom that killed off $800 million worth of salmon in Chile to rising ocean temperatures, and they say other aquaculture operations around the world are at risk.</description>

      <description>Most anchovies and herring commercially fished in California end up as fishmeal or bait, not on dinner plates. Now there’s a movement to get people to eat, not waste, small fish, and that could help preserve bigger species.</description>
