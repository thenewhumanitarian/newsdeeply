      <description>As sea ice disappears and more ships ply routes like the Northwest Passage in the late summer, better safety and conservation measures will be needed to protect marine mammals, scientists say.</description>

      <description>A decade of research has found that the muscles and eggs of birds in the far-flung Aleutian Islands contain endocrine-disrupting phthalates from plastics the animals have ingested, prompting Alaskan tribes to begin testing native foods for contamination.</description>

      <description>New research documents how important the algae that thrive under sea ice are to the Arctic food chain. But as sea ice disappears and the region warms, the timing and abundance of ice algae blooms is in flux.</description>

      <description>Veteran oceanographer Eddy Carmack has witnessed five decades of accelerating change in the Arctic. As he accepted a lifetime achievement award in January, he talks about why ‘pan-Arctic’ research that crosses borders and disciplines is now imperative.</description>

      <description>Scientists have found that melting sea ice is increasing the flow of nutrients into the central Arctic from the continental shelf. That could disrupt the marine food chain in unpredictable ways.</description>

      <description>Climate change has irreversibly changed the Arctic from its reliably frozen past. Recently, U.S. government researchers, dubbing it the ‘New Arctic,’ said there’s little chance of going back to the way things were.</description>

      <description>From building barriers to buttress unstable marine ice sheets to thickening sea ice with a wind-powered pump, researchers want to start more conversations about climate interventions that don’t depend on actually cutting greenhouse gas emissions.</description>

      <description>Alone on a remote northern Alaska island, biologist George Divoky has been monitoring a population of sea ice-dependent black guillemots for four decades. Now he fears he’s watching the colony in a slow-motion collapse as temperatures rise and its prey disappears. </description>
