      <description>In June, an expedition set off to explore a poorly understood region of the deep sea near the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. NOAA expedition coordinator Kasey Cantwell describes the discoveries that surprised scientists.</description>

      <description>Farmed Atlantic salmon don’t fare well in the wild. That’s a problem when they escape their pens and breed with vulnerable Atlantic salmon populations, spreading their genes. Scientists are now urging aquaculture companies to consider raising fish that won’t reproduce.</description>

      <description>An extensive survey of the Great Barrier Reef finds that a spike in ocean temperatures in 2016 led to a fall in populations of parrotfish, which keep corals healthy and help them recover from bleaching events by eating harmful algae.</description>

      <description>With one of the ocean’s iconic predators globally threatened, a shark tagging program off the shores of Long Island is an effort to understand behaviors of young in a marine region where their numbers may be increasing.</description>

      <description>The combination of tagging and social media has helped both scientists and the public engage with the ocean’s most feared predator in new ways. Jim Ware, who has tweeted as Mary Lee – the world’s most famous shark since Jaws – tells Oceans Deeply about his experience.</description>

      <description>Near the coast of Japan, the annual spawning ritual of the normally elusive deep-sea creatures attracts the attention of fishers and scientists. Despite years of study, no one fully understands how or why they bioluminesce.  </description>

      <description>A 2016 expedition near Bermuda found new species and biological communities thriving on the seabed relatively near shore. Alex Rogers, science director of the Nekton Oxford Deep Ocean Exploration Institute, says the discovery shows how little we know about marine life.</description>

      <description>The scuttling of 52 German warships off Scotland nearly a century ago during World War I spawned a habitat for a diverse array of crab, lobster, starfish, sea urchin and fish. Now bottom trawling and climate change is imperiling that refuge, say two researchers.</description>

      <description>Rapidly advancing technology allows scientists to find elusive sharks by detecting their DNA signature in the water. That could help devise more effective protections for predators decimated by overfishing and other threats.</description>

      <description>Lionfish are decimating valuable native species in the western Atlantic Ocean, but spearing the predators hasn’t been enough to slow their spread. Now scientists and fishers are developing traps and other technology to catch the voracious fish en masse.</description>

      <description>Since California imposed clean air restrictions on vessels that travel through state waters, the number of fatal collisions with the big marine mammals has fallen as captains slow down. But much more needs to be done to reduce ship strikes, marine biologists say.</description>

      <description>As the world’s marine ecosystems face increasing threats, scientists disagree on whether the trend toward huge, remote reserves is a promising new development or a worrisome distraction.</description>

      <description>Mars is mapped in better detail than the ocean floor, which is why a project on the scale of some space missions was launched to change that. Listen to experts discuss how Seabed 2030 will work and what it could mean for marine conservation.</description>

      <description>The predators’ annual migration to a remote area of the Pacific Ocean has long remained a mystery. Now scientists have embarked on a mission to investigate just what the great whites are doing during their sojourn. The answers could help protect the region.</description>

      <description>A new study finds that the extreme coral bleaching event of 2016 devastated the world’s largest coral reef and is dramatically altering coral ecosystems as marine heat waves become more frequent.</description>

      <description>An international team of researchers finds that seabirds aren’t shifting their breeding times as ocean temperatures rise, which risks putting them out of sync with the availability of prey to find for their young.</description>

      <description>Scientists recalculated historical catch data to find that bottom trawlers that scrape the seafloor with huge nets may be killing far more fish – and destroying more habitats – than previously thought.</description>

      <description>Scientists in Australia have documented how the composition of coral species affects the survival of fish populations following bleaching events. As small fish key to coral health disappear, reefs’ resilience to future catastrophes could decline.</description>
