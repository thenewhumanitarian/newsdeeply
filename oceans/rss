      <description>Farmed Atlantic salmon don’t fare well in the wild. That’s a problem when they escape their pens and breed with vulnerable Atlantic salmon populations, spreading their genes. Scientists are now urging aquaculture companies to consider raising fish that won’t reproduce.</description>

      <description>NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch is in the midst of a global project to collect data and assess damage from marine heatwaves that devastated coral reefs worldwide. Scientists hope the data will improve future forecasts, helping ecologists take action before temperature spikes.</description>

      <description>When glossing over who marine plastic pollution really will affect by averaging risk, we may ignore harms to vulnerable populations, says Max Liboiron, a researcher who runs the Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research in Canada.</description>

      <description>In the wake of catastrophic bleaching events, scientists find that coral cover on the world’s biggest reef system is near record lows, while other research shows recovery will be “slow and painful” as only a tiny number of coral larvae are repopulating devastated reefs.</description>
