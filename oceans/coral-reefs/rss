      <description>NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch is in the midst of a global project to collect data and assess damage from marine heatwaves that devastated coral reefs worldwide. Scientists hope the data will improve future forecasts, helping ecologists take action before temperature spikes.</description>

      <description>An extensive survey of the Great Barrier Reef finds that a spike in ocean temperatures in 2016 led to a fall in populations of parrotfish, which keep corals healthy and help them recover from bleaching events by eating harmful algae.</description>

      <description>New research shows that snails that prey on coral play a bigger role than realized in coral health. But the good news is that reducing fishing can help keep snail populations in check.</description>

      <description>Last year, a bold initiative set out to locate coral reefs most likely to survive global warming. That turned out to be far easier said than done – but now scientists hope the results will rally attention to regions where there’s hope to save crucial marine ecosystems.</description>

      <description>With data from 1,800 tropical coral reefs, new research weighs in on an ongoing conservation debate: whether it’s better to preserve marine areas that are still pristine or those that need the most protection.</description>

      <description>In the wake of catastrophic bleaching events, scientists find that coral cover on the world’s biggest reef system is near record lows, while other research shows recovery will be “slow and painful” as only a tiny number of coral larvae are repopulating devastated reefs.</description>

      <description>In India’s Gulf of Mannar, more than a decade of efforts have spurred a slow recovery of coral reefs that protect the coast and feed communities. But climate change has reversed that success.</description>

      <description>Researchers studied more than 200 tropical reefs and found that few will grow fast enough to keep pace with higher water levels due to climate change. This means the reefs won’t be able to break destructive waves that can wreak havoc on coastal communities.</description>

      <description>Researchers have found that the top layer of coral reefs prevents $4 billion in flood damage annually by breaking up waves that propel destructive storm surges. As storms increase in frequency and force, reefs play a crucial role in protecting coastal property.</description>

      <description>A 2016 expedition near Bermuda found new species and biological communities thriving on the seabed relatively near shore. Alex Rogers, science director of the Nekton Oxford Deep Ocean Exploration Institute, says the discovery shows how little we know about marine life.</description>

      <description>Lionfish are decimating valuable native species in the western Atlantic Ocean, but spearing the predators hasn’t been enough to slow their spread. Now scientists and fishers are developing traps and other technology to catch the voracious fish en masse.</description>

      <description>Environmentalists in Mexico have fought the recent relocation of a coral reef to make way for bigger ships in the Port of Veracruz. They worry about the ecosystem impacts of the port expansion and the precedent it sets for uprooting corals.</description>

      <description>Scientists in Australia have documented how the composition of coral species affects the survival of fish populations following bleaching events. As small fish key to coral health disappear, reefs’ resilience to future catastrophes could decline.</description>
