      <description>It may have been 16 years since the death of former Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, but his legacy still lives on in the war-torn country’s sectarian politics.</description>

      <description>Unless concrete measures are taken to support the steadily shrinking Assyrian community in Hassakeh province, one of the region’s most ancient communities may soon be gone, writes Syrian commentator Mardean Isaac.</description>

      <description>The mainstream Palestinian stance on the Syrian war is hypocritical, writes journalist Mariam Barghouti. By choosing political pragmatism over the right to self-determination – a right central to the Palestinian cause – Palestinians are asking Syrians to do what they have refused for more than 60 years.</description>

      <description>As battles rage between ISIS and al-Nusra Front in Yarmouk refugee camp, civilians are being caught in the line of fire. With supplies in the camp running low, activists now fear a humanitarian crisis and have launched a social media campaign calling for a temporary cease-fire.</description>

      <description>Jabal Turkman in northern Latakia has been a battlefield since the beginning of the Syrian conflict. But this past week, the last remaining villagers fled, leaving more than 20 villages abandoned. Turkmen villagers now worry the Assad government will attempt to repopulate the mountain with loyalists.</description>

      <description>The series #5YearsWeFled is a collection of interviews with a Syrian lawyer Ayman Jalwan. It highlights the difficult choice that Syrians face – between dying in a war zone that the country has become after five years or conflict, or fleeing the land they love with no hopes of imminent return.</description>

      <description>The PYD and its YPG and YPJ militias regularly, and often forcibly, recruit child soldiers and deploy them to the battlefield, writes Eva Savelsberg. The U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group, which has closely partnered with the PYD, should not allow a war against extremism supersede child rights.</description>

      <description>If the battle against ISIS is ever to succeed, the U.S. and Turkey must bridge their steadily widening divide regarding the role of Syrian Kurds in the fight against the extremists, write Francis Ricciardone and Aaron Stein.</description>
