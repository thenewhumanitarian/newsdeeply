      <description>Bloodshed has followed Syrian refugees across the country’s borders, from this month’s bombing in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli that left more than 50 civilians dead, to the Lebanese city of Tripoli, where Sunni–Shiite strife has exploded. And ever-expanding refugee camps are biting away at already limited natural resources. Jordan’s infamous Zaatari refugee camp, the second largest camp in the world, is now the Hashemite Kingdom’s fifth-largest city. These large camps have especially harmed neighboring communities in Jordan, some of whom have suffered weeks without water and deal with continuous price hikes of essential goods.</description>

      <description>Anyone who has spent a summer in Syria knows it’s unpleasant. Average high temperatures can hit 96 F / 35 C. Pre-revolution, the heat simply meant sweaty taxi rides, nights in rooms with no AC, and minor dehydration while shopping. But over two years of war, Syrian civilians now live with limited or no access to electricity, medicine or water. Refugees often live in unsanitary camps that are breeding grounds for diseases. As summer hits the region, these struggles will only intensify.</description>
