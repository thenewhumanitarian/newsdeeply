      <description>Russia’s 11-hour ‘humanitarian pause’ to facilitate evacuations from eastern Aleppo will not allow for much-needed aid, but rather, is part of an overall strategy for a military solution to the conflict, says Middle East analyst Sharif Nashashibi.</description>

      <description>Instead of driving a wedge between regional players, the Syrian conflict’s duration and intractability has forced proxy powers to prioritize cooperation over rivalry for their wider interests, according to Middle East analyst Sharif Nashashibi.</description>

      <description>In a surprise move on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the Kremlin would withdraw the majority of its forces based in Syria. But rather than a sign of mission accomplished, Russia’s departure may be a warning to an “over-confident regime” that Moscow’s support is not unconditional.</description>

      <description>The peace talks between the Assad government and representatives of the Syrian opposition are to begin today, but Syrians have little faith in any positive outcome, because non-Syrians are dictating the parameters of the discussion, writes Middle East analyst Sharif Nashashibi.</description>

      <description>With no mention of embattled President Bashar al-Assad, the “milestone” resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council on Friday is the latest example of a peace process that is entirely missing the point, writes political analyst Sharif Nashashibi.</description>

      <description>British lawmakers chose to support ineffective military action in Syria on Wednesday, without tackling the ideology behind ISIS and the legitimate grievances it manipulates for recruitment purposes, writes Sharif Nashashibi. “The logic seems to be: if dropping bombs has not worked, drop more”.</description>

      <description>Bashar al-Assad can now sit more comfortably as the world focuses on the evils of the self-proclaimed Islamic State while overlooking the fact that Syrian government forces are responsible for the vast majority of death and violence in Syria since the crisis began in 2011, says Sharif Nashashibi.</description>

      <description>Global powers are discussing a political solution to the conflict in Syria without inviting Syrians to the table. As we circle back around on the endless merry-go-round of detached talks, argues the author, we shouldn’t be surprised by the lack of any effective change on the ground.</description>

      <description>That ISIS benefits from Russia’s military involvement is no surprise, and is not even a coincidence or unfortunate by-product, argues the writer. The stronger ISIS gets, the more people will buy into the flawed notion that Assad is an indispensable partner in the group’s defeat. Assad hence becomes part of the solution to the Syrian conflict rather than part of the problem, or in fact the cause.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to fathom, writes political analyst Sharif Nashashibi, but the situation in Syria is about to get a lot worse.</description>
