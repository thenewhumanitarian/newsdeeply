      <description>“The weather is bad, so no MiGs today, ” says Abdu, my driver, as two French journalists and I roll into Aleppo under heavy fog.  The bad weather will likely protect us from jets, but not from Scud-like weapons – the tactical ballistic missiles, first developed by the Soviet Union, which have now rained down for weeks on this besieged city.</description>

      <description>Patrick Hilsman is an American journalist based in Beirut, contributing to Syria Deeply. Last week he was reporting from Aleppo during Syria’s nationwide internet blackout. A satellite connection made him one of the few people in Syria still connected to the web; he used the connection to join us in a Google Hangout from Aleppo. This is his log of the trip, in and out of a warzone.  .</description>
