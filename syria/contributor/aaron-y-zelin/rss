      <description>ISIS has not released any propaganda pictures or videos demonstrating its ability to govern in nearly a month, which might suggest the group is retreating from its territorial aspirations. However, Aaron Y. Zelin, fellow of the Washington Institute, argues otherwise.</description>

      <description>In a small town in Nabeul governorate, east of Tunis, on the last day of August 2013, I sat down with a Tunisian that fought in Syria for six months and has since returned home.
