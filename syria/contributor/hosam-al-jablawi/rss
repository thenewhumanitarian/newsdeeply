      <description>Some 23,000 Syrian teachers took refuge in Turkey, and while many are unemployed, some found work in temporary schools for refugees. Syrian journalist Hosam al-Jablawi says many now fear for their jobs as Turkey tries to integrate refugees into the national system.</description>

      <description>Nour al-Din al-Zenki was considered one of the strongest moderate factions fighting with the Free Syrian Army in the early years of the war, but after foreign aid stopped flowing to the rebel group in 2015, it allied with more radical forces. </description>

      <description>As local governance structures grow stronger in Syria, a decentralized government appeals to many in the country. However, both government and opposition forces fear that decentralization may eventually lead to partitioning the country, which they want to keep unified.</description>
