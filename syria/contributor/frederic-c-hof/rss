      <description>As the destruction in Aleppo continues, the Atlantic Council’s Frederic C. Hof argues that the White House is both unable and unwilling to facilitate the implementation of cease-fire negotiations but has put the blame on the Syrian opposition. </description>

      <description>Though Russia and the U.S. tout opposing narratives on Syria, both their policies resulted in the ongoing destruction in that country. Eventually, however, someone will have to shoulder the cost of rebuilding, writes Middle East expert Frederic C. Hof.   </description>

      <description>It seems there is little left to compel President Bashar al-Assad to comply with the U.N.-led peace process in Geneva, writes Frederic C. Hof. The embattled Syrian leader has flat out rejected the idea of a transitional body, and has used the recess in negotiations to resume bombing civilians.</description>

      <description>“To date the Obama administration’s idea of Syrians fighting ISIS out of love of country has centered on the Syrian Army and nationalist rebels eventually linking arms and marching eastward after Bashar al-Assad has obligingly retired … ” writes Frederic C. Hof.  “It is a nice image, but when exactly is this supposed to happen?”.</description>

      <description>When it comes to Washington’s strategy in Syria, the shaky truce and the ongoing peace talks in Geneva, the best we can hope for is a “process-without-end,” writes Frederic C. Hof, and one that will allow Obama to hand off a “semi-contained Syrian crisis” to his successor when he leaves office.</description>

      <description>Russian president Vladimir Putin has duped the west, writes Fredric Hof, using a military solution to fix the only aspect of the Syrian crisis he deems worth solving: the preservation of Bashar al-Assad’s rule in at least part of the country. But Russian free reign in Syria has global consequences.</description>
