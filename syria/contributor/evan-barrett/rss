    <title>Syria contributor: Evan Barrett</title>
    <description>Evan Barrett is the Deputy Director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force and a Political Advisor for the Coalition for a Democratic Syria. Before working with the Syrian-American community, he lived in Beirut and spent a significant amount of time across the border in Damascus. He is one of three people living in Washington naive enough to remain inspired by the promise of the Arab Spring.
