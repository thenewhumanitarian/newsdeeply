    <title>Syria contributor: Mahmoud Mustafa</title>
    <description>Mahmoud Mustafa is a field ophthalmologist and the director and founder of Independent Doctors Association (IDA), a Syrian humanitarian organization that consists of Syrian medics who provide healthcare services to the population of northern Syria. Aleppo native Mustafa and his colleagues work to reactivate and rehabilitate health facilities in the opposition-held parts of the region in an effort to cover the health needs of people living in one of Syria’s most war-torn regions. Faced with the persistent attacks on health workers in the region, Mustafa and IDA are strong advocates for the protection of medical workers and facilities in Syria.
