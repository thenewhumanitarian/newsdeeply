    <title>Syria contributor: Henry Hogger</title>
    <description>Henry Hogger served as the British Ambassador to Syria from 2000-2003. He has personally met Assad and all of the key players in the conflict, and has also worked as a diplomat in Iraq and Jordan, giving him unprecedented insight into Syria’s relationships with the rest of the region. Currently, Henry works with a consultancy organisation, Middle East Consultants (MEC) International on the Middle East Minorities Inititative, which is a project to identify practical ways to support minority groups facing discrimination or persecution in the region.
