      <description>Every time I have to travel to Egypt, my heart jumps with joy like a little girl about to go to an amusement park. Egypt has and will always have a special place in my heart. It was the place I was born, it’s where I went to university, where I first fell in love, and, finally, where I started to work with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</description>

      <title>Lessons of Domiz Refugee Camp</title>

      <description>I have to confess that when I set foot in Erbil Airport three weeks ago, I was nervous. I was on my way to visit Iraqi Kurdistan’s Domiz refugee camp, and I had not been to the Kurdistan region of Iraq in more than 13 years. Back then, when I worked with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Baghdad, I cannot profess to have really known Kurdistan or its population. The UN’s complicated relationship with Saddam Hussein was no secret, and has to some extent meant that our relations with the average Iraqi citizens back then – including its Kurdish population – was limited and awkward.</description>
