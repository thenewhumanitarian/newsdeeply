      <description>The Syrian war has transformed women’s role in the workforce, giving way to opportunities previously reserved for men. As women take on more responsibility and autonomy, for many opportunity does not mean equality.</description>

      <description>The rise of independent Syrian news outlets created more opportunities for women in the media, but many of Syria’s female journalists still face higher security risks than their male colleagues and rampant sexism in the workplace.</description>

      <description>The explosive remnants of war pose a long-term threat to reconstruction and peacebuilding efforts in Syria. Women, however, are playing a notably growing role as humanitarian groups shift their focus to land-mine clearing and risk education.</description>

      <description>The conflict in Syria has shifted traditional roles within communities and more women are starting to play roles in politics at all levels. But their overall influence remains minimal, leaving Syria’s destiny in the hands of men.</description>

      <description>Both men and women experience abuse in the prisons run by most of the groups fighting in Syria – from the time they are arrested to the moment when, or if, they are released. But for women, the consequences and impact can be much worse.</description>

      <description>The sale and trade of women in Syria is not a wanton and senseless consequence of war. It is a consequence of a war economy in which nearly all warring parties and even civilians use women to secure profit, weapons, access or leverage in negotiations. </description>

      <description>Sexual violence continues to be used on all sides of the Syrian conflict, but in a society that forces victims to suffer in silence, documenting instances of rape is nearly impossible and the consequences for survivors are devastating. </description>

      <description>For many Syrian women, destruction of the country’s medical system means access to health facilities can be determined by location. But as hospitals and clinics continue to come under attack, civil society organizations are trying to fill the gap in women’s healthcare. </description>

      <description>A major barrier to Syrian women’s education – both inside and outside the country – is the information gap that makes applying for asylum and finding education opportunities a labyrinth of confusion.</description>
